# mysql@5.7 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
# because this is an alternate version of another formula.

# For compilers to find mysql@5.7 you may need to set:
#   export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/mysql@5.7/lib"
#   export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/mysql@5.7/include"

# For pkg-config to find mysql@5.7 you may need to set:
#   export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/mysql@5.7/lib/pkgconfig"

# To have launchd start mysql@5.7 now and restart at login:
#   brew services start mysql@5.7
# Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
#   /usr/local/opt/mysql@5.7/bin/mysql.server start

# As with config/credentials.yml, you never want to store sensitive information,
# like your database password, in your source code. If your source code is
# ever seen by anyone, they now have access to your database.
#
# Instead, provide the password as a unix environment variable when you boot
# the app. Read https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database
# for a full rundown on how to provide these environment variables in a
# production deployment.
#
# On Heroku and other platform providers, you may have a full connection URL
# available as an environment variable. For example:
#
#   DATABASE_URL="mysql2://myuser:mypass@localhost/somedatabase"
#
# You can use this database configuration with:
#
#   production:
